  <h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hey, I'm George Liaskas, and I've recently taken my first steps into the exciting realm of web development. It's been a thrilling ride, delving into the building blocks of websites with HTML, fine-tuning styles with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript. I'm passionate about creating seamless user experiences and love experimenting with front-end frameworks like React to bring my ideas to life. As I dive deeper into the world of web development, I'm eager to explore back-end technologies and databases to build even more dynamic and robust applications."
</p>

<p>Beyond the code, I'm a dedicated learner with a keen eye for design and usability. I believe in the power of clean, accessible, and responsive web design to create meaningful online experiences. Constantly seeking out new challenges and learning opportunities, I'm an active member of the web development community, always eager to collaborate and share insights. With each project, I'm not only building websites but also refining my skills and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital space.</p>

<p>This was my first project that I created when i was starting,it means a lot to me !</p>
